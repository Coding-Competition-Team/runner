## Credentials

In order for the runner to interface with the MySQL DB and Portainer, credentials (IP/URL addresses, usernames, passwords, etc.) need to be provided.

A sample JSON credentials file has been provided in ``credentials.example.json``, which should be copied to a file named ``credentials.json`` with the fields filled out.
